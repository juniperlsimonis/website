  alt_text: "Juniper at a table in a library conference room. They are sitting at the far end, looking across the table at the camera, the table top is pale green with brown trim, the walls are white and plain, with two light fixtures on the walls aiming upwards. Juniper is wearing a long sleeve dress shirt (white with light grey specks), black suspenders, and a blue white and black bow tie. Their hair is relatively short, tapered down to a bizz near their ears, but shaggy and a little mullet-like. They are writing with a black pen in a small notebook and are flanked by propped open text books, a laptop, and a mason jar of water. They are staring at the camera smizing and smirking."
