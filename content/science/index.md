  alt_text: "Juniper writing some math at a white board (the sum of rho sub i times x sub i over i from 1 to N) while looking back at the camera over their left shoulder. Their hair is close shaved around the sides and done up in a curly mess. Their eye brows are sharp and they are wearing dangly circle earrings with silver hoops and blue beads. They are giving a smirky smize look at the camera and their freckles are plentiful and multi-colored."
